# Laravel for Hostgator Shared Hosting

Laravel requires a minimum version of 5.3.7 to run. For New Hostgator Accounts(Commissioned after 16 May, 2013) this is the default. 

However, for legacy account (Shared accounts before May 1, 2013 and Reseller accounts before May 16, 2013) the  default version is PHP 5.2 and one would need to add handlers for PHP 5.3. This can be a tedious process especially if you deploy several applications over the lifetime of your Hostgator Account.

This is simply an implementation of Laravel 4 for Shared and Reseller Accounts. For more details about laravel check the repository
